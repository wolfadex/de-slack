# De-Slack

A proof of concept decentrailized chat app

## Dev

- Run `yarn` to install all JavaScript dependencies
- Run `yarn dev` to start up the dev server
- Navigate to `localhost:8000/server.html` to start the chat server
- Navigate to `localhost:8000` to start a chat client


## How it works

- Copy the address from the server
- Paste the server's address into the input on the client and press `Enter`/`Return`
- This connects the client to the server
- Connect as many clients as you want
- Fill in the message input and press `Enter`/`Return` to send the message

## Todo

- [ ] Test outside of localhost
- [ ] Customize username
- [ ] "login"
- [ ] Storing state of server
- [ ] Exporting server data
- [ ] Importing server data
- [ ] Creating channels
- [ ] Direct messages
